Substance A always reacts to Substance B

Suppose you could not remember when the small boats
Took to the moors on trust

It is written that
When doubt came:

(sense deception, forgery and the like)
A hunger ago this table didn't exist

Nor did the mountain
And this wine

Nor did the murder
Or this wolf

Masks a false picture of doubt
Perhaps scientific, perhaps philosophical




You know that the world
Is 100 years old

There must be some basic principle
Where ice cream is really magic

And crows gather in the evening
Trees as no one watches
