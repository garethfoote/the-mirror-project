You: expert in enchantment
perched on the
bone-littered stove


swoop
                           rooms
               between


letâ€™s pull
our city
down from the sky! you cry

descend like demigods
a little dirty
from exhaust and i-beams

grief chews up
the street a girl with tire-
eyes smudges

her hands
ravens
our jeans


slaps at the
                           pools left
               black


here is where the gods lie
baffled:
the carbuncled girder that is this city

snaps out rust, wheezes deck-plate
mists desperate to command the trestles
you caw


decide

                         to alight
          like Freyja


on the couch
stare at a new episode
of Lost

black walnut
held
between your teeth
