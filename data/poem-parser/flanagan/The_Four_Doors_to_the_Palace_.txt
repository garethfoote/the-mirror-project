The Four Doors to the Palace

fire in wind has found a friend
for sudden change it recommends:

it sparks my shirt
it carrot - cakes
pulls red leaves up to shadow-shape
the rabbit props a day's fair friend, where love and grief is mere pretend

the flame-bark bows to ruby lip; its leaves
distend 'round heaps of mud-earth men
 gather war-cry
to reach the end of shoveling days, thereby:
in thought, unshoveling, time's all spent
consumed by heat's
long lost lament
