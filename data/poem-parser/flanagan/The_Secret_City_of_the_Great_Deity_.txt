The Secret City of the Great Deity

               If I told you about the time I was falsely arrested for
Stealing cookies in college would you still buy me ice cream? I was innocent!

As innocent as the fat rooster sacrificed
by the men in the next door fish warehouse

Stay red and dark and safe from evil
               And though the fish smell can get pretty bad

Possessing special powers to ascend and descend
They also string above the door

Tinkling pebbles
To make the rats think twice about dancing

Things possessing anomalous forms are
Born with divine natures
