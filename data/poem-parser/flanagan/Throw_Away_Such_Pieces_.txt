Throw Away Such Pieces


a voice wakes me saying

                             she is forgetting


        in the next room

                 a slow surgery
                  extraction :: removal process ::

when one thing
      (person, animal, possibly at times vegetable)

is so attached
to another

                 the seams are lost

so made into
the other
