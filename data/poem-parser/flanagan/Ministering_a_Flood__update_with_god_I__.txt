Holy Savior, or some such
divine wind, make
these simple pleas
your own life's mission:
Holy Savior, stain my
glasses with your solutions
(pictures, please). The kids left all
of their chores, rapunzelled out windows,
stuffed themselves into animals
and have gotten out whole
through the hold. Just so you know,
we noticed that at least the mammals
can talk. Holy Savior, please
make animals again
from all the girls'
heeled boots
