       Like all twin giants, I have no brothers
       No brother spins peace into myself
       No brother gets in the car (I am drive)
       Brothers have no language for "adult"
       No words to fork "interests"
       One washes clothes with grass, the other, teeth and soap
Disgusting! For a while it seemed
       One had aged
         Or you were charitable

Lies!            Such ideas
        Stir a man's
           ability to cloud-cloud

        A brother cup is made for drinking
        A brother hand is cold for years
