On Being From


Oh! Rodeo, Rodeo,
My brother works at Ponderosa
Wears a blue bandana     sprays dishes
In between Karate practice, while other young cowboys

Sear steaks to plunk on plastic trays
I know or I am certain there is a hospital down the trail
And volunteer there in high school
Lasso the plastic butter pats away

From the elderly who swallow butter secrets whole
I am certain there are chairs there, and beds, and campfires; In second grade
I stop breathing in that hospital
Wild horses kick up red dust under the window

Now the Ponderosa is one of Bulgarian importance
A diner called Andrea's
Where the search party stops:
Food, something to do, when no one

Is hungry, when no one is herding ketchup as my father
Lies in an unfamiliar tent, unable to see the stars
Sparking the broad ink of the sky
My niece arrives on her baby's first birthday

Branding tools dangle over the Pepsi machine
The rest arrive for the funeral on horseback
All the shaking manes parked outside
Polish the water-streaked marks from the colors of cars
