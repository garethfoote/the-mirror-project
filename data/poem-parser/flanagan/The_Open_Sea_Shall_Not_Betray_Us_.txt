     dayâ€™s awakener of virtue
    far-weeping goes {

    wight-skilled (in expectation)

             striking        eyes       dim

     }


       her snow     fell for years     her hunger:
     dayling -eyes
     cut wing's feather-blade for early    sunrise

                     fog the father's frolic day



     Great Progenitor!              {   }

         impose frugality     (choosling:

     spring was dawning itself)
      the first cake of homecoming:



             carried her down into itself

             a narrow mountain function {

                                              innards of the mountain [she did appear]

         amidst the rarity of food (rarity = here)

     }
