Wittgenstein asked, "What could a mistake here be like?"
         a mistake doesn't have a cause
it has a ground        bound to it to sit on it    a mass of earth


that is still a mistake
         a wrongly storm
a checking twice        a windy negligence     (its muddy


tire-pushed rut)
          a mistake here cannot be verified
it is a lone walk home          a false set of branches covering


a lit twilight window that yellows
         the street    leaves
roping slowly as witnesses waking into their own windy statements such as direction:


thataway everything speaks
       for the earth that's not the point
       the ground for conviction              is a world-picture


a kind of mythology
        forged in storm canals and breaking levees
The bank of the river is made of hard rock     of stone it has seen it all


the mistake
       has formed a system of sympathy
uncertain of any fact       descending slowly
