From tankards scooped in sky
Things floating are god-quiet

          Inebriate breathing
          Beamed, from where there is no - thing
          Moving to
          A grassed some - thing

Tufted ending summer day
It is this place where sits
The social nature of the bush
          its ferocious leaves atremble
          debating wind-prattle

Rabbiting on

Reeling, saints to windows run

Eyes --
                 cold, plated--   peer upward
