The Truth in Rabbits

whether a proposition turns out false or not
depends on how hard my brother hits the ground
grounded        too old to have a
skull operation, sisterly wishful thinking

still --
an arrow through the swimming pool
shot by a suburban hunter post-middle school?
the difference between the concept of

good and that of evil rests entirely in
my brother a perfect demonstration in which no one can
be certain not the rabbits he traps in silvery metal bins later to
skin raw in the kitchen blood pooling today's news

on the linoleum the protests of mother
Suppose now I say, two arrows? A commotion in the yard: One arrow
in Gunga Din's back colonized native waterbearer
the finest man I knew dies onscreen a deep wrong

from the TV in my bedroom a sick girl
sounds the alarm with the bugle unable to save the innocent. Nonsense!
Coughing ensues I hoard other rabbits in the bathtub Father
builds a hutch so they can last through the winter
