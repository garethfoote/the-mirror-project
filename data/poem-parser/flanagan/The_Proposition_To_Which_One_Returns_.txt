My sister climbed trees when
she might be of use when it was her turn for dishes
when someone would call her name
she was bark      she was branch, reaching

for other oaks, hoping they would stay true
would stay as she and I would      years
later at a bedside in the night hospital
talking as fruits as leaves

shaken tales about her son who as a six-foot-four student
saves old egg noodles in bags takes them
as rations    between jobs as noodle comfort sucking them to stay awake--
in his timber legs he would not ask

the punchclock pulps eleven the last-shift cars start for home
my sister and I    each holding father
sapling fingers       cool and ready tell story after story then a spring
takes his breath and     makes it into wind

over a nighttime forest     and the moon pokes
proud into his knotted kitchen cabinets over the
shimmering double toothed bundles these leftover noodles hoarded in
small clear bags through years of autumn
