 I'll tell you
       what it is. I'll hand you outcry.
We drive. Grey commandeers the car and exhausts your
mouth. Notions of telling. Road bends-
 we see over brushwood thickets.

Dressed for Sunday, mopmakers
whose hands have scrubbed
corners from church toilets, stillborn pennies; easy-
  find a course of violet, tie a small cloth.

Instructions for living in coal mines. We peat a little,
sinking. After confessions and ammonia. After coughing,
caring for the small too cold ones. Here-
  mothers bring final things.

Little knots on trees make a sorry each,
mighty woods bend heavy, hair locks bear tiny socks, keen
those hands. How
  we come to blessing.
