the houses
skimmed so orderly I
had no idiom how to


let me tell you a little something about my kidneys
let me tell you a little secret about my liver
who's got the power to make more blood

to make you say silt

let me tell you a little something about my kilometers
let me tell you a little security about my loan
who's got the pram to make more blouse

to make you say silver

a little glance puts shark
teeth into her mouth
one by one

the clouds forget animal marionettes
the clouds fortress a stately second house

bold partridges pillbox into tall seabirds

clinging
                   supporting
the others
