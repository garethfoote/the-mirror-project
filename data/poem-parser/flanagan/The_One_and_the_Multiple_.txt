collected symbols
crowd under the cliffs
now me      among the wives of the eels

I am stop swimming
swimming me      I am
not-remaining

full
not-staying
sleeping

a body deeply
and bigger
than others

no alewife, no fish channels
inside the walls
you, smoked, on our full full bed

your iron-fin, a muffling
against the sound (blanketed)
the noise against entirely

drains minutes--
full of history
of loose and animal

I dissolve the granite's white small light
as coal-mine
I dissolve as whale-prey      as song
