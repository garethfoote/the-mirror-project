I am:
     a feisty dragon
     a horse biting
                           clouds

Chopping down              trees
formerly used to
    impede
nomadic cavalry

The leftover
subject
     of high
     antiquity

To the South
birds render singing
into       strips of bark and reed   press
songs into them

Leftover girl
     demon-queller
 face as radiant
as blossoms

Flys high
    on a pillow
in the form of a theatre
