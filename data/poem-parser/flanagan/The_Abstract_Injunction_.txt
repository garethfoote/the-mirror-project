The Abstract Injunction


the god
entirely other
is everywhere that can
be entirely
found
yes, in something:
how about
current and stunted trout
or in the
gezaged
members of the
speaking-ground
         glass
freezes
water into
windows
         and
since each one
     (our
            everyone)
is different
is
        (infinitely other)
is
absolutely
more more
in the sound
nonmanifest
then yes, there is
the glow
inaccessible
transcending
solitary
        members
of
the tree
