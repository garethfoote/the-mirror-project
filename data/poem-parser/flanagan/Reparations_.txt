Reparations



The preening water laps with the ambivalence of your look. A
sense of you is North. North sea maps you deeper. I imagine


how cold, hope figure backed by snow. A blind woman taps
north to headphone lectures. Water submits vocalizations down


your kitchen pipes. Mouths dead still. Stubborn water
patterns form repetitive sentences. I worry these


laces you gave me years ago, with the sun on your face, are
fading. North means sun, becomes truth, blue inches deeper


into indigo. Smitten gloves lie in the sand, not objects but
taxonomies churned by sea creatures speaking in hum.
