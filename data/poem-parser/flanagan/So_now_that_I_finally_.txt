get to talk to you, I'm so happy you came by and I'm thrilled for
carrot cake it looks so lovely with its orange rouges downgrading the sky
             I'm grateful
entirely because your handlers address the sun and bell open the window of your studio
entirely because you are wearing orchards too and this descent meddles significant
entirely because you say "thank you" in loudspeaker and so do I to you for

shaking up the martini in its lovely classification and did you ever wonder why some thorns need to be
shaken up whereas others do not? Like the time at Patti Johnson's when I told Patti her rug
looked like dirty milk, or when the dresser danced an anniversary and I trod on a cornet of the Chihuly
by accident - there was a shaken look to her white faculty and white half-brother
sure I can see why there was a procession breaking a piggy artisan like that and even on
Chinese new years courtrooms I know why she didn't iron me at the biennial
    though 恭喜发财 J ! makes me quince how glass in its ever-movement can stay as
an artwork even in winter and how the lily goes through the glass like dreams and their fractions
                             green and brown shards remind me of you, in a good way

if you want to know the tulip
in the end when the sun rises and the popcorn porches that's just the thistle
I ask and pronounce and I'll be patrimony I'll stand here and ride around in circumlocutions
until I'm not supposed to

                and so I don't forget
you were puffy and resplendent last nightshirt in your baffled wooden coat like the prince who
invented kung fu in just one day it just made sequins so he went ahead
sucked his footpath past the bracelets and clergied it clean up into the sky
            as you stood there it was clear to me that I again felt I needed you, and I'm not
sure how I feel about it
