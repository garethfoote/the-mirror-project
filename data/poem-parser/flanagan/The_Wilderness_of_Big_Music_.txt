The Wilderness of Big Music

At the library, the security guard told me
His woes. He married a daughter of the Calm family
Her happiness was locked in a suitcase
And her name was Beautiful Girl. She gave birth to Fondness
Those who take one of her feathers
Will not suffer from jealousy. Will not fly into rage.
Will not fall ill from peacocks

Each time she goes out of town
The guard gathers shiny things in his
Pocket-nest, like the prettiest
Tiniest dinosaurs holding their
Fine-fierce feather vanes A happiness within
The baggage of Beautiful Girl lures
Scarlet pheasants into intercessions

And rowdy all night songs on the mini-lawns
Of gas stations everywhere

Her animal? When it comes Mostly leopard. Its drink is
The name of Beautiful girl
Like a wild grape sounds under water.
