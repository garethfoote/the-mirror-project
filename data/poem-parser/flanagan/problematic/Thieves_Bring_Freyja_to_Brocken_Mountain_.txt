who treks up Black Horse Road
mauling the passageway?
  Two cats: Bee-gold and Tree-gold
escort earthâ€™s daughter over clay

 Propped up in sand are object-codes:
old witch-style brooms hold ballast-sway
Walpurgis night medieval mumble-odes
          her heavenly books in Asgard

 the greatest latest breakfast: women bestrode
a broken brunching tramway
Harz mountain sits high, unbowed
house-kit scrawl this first of May

A bear in the blow, a raptor to prey:
it was She to Odin runes bestowed
   thus her symbols do foresway            (a foot with a saint-stain steeped up halfway)

drawing water-ditch        though her body slowed

rooted, she becomes willowy, gay
her blackwood bird-box mouths and goads:
In sharp terms tip-bend the ground breaks
       caw-snap sharp
                                 scratch-jay moan

magpies nudge her house astray
brick chimneys do corrode:
They take the stones and make away
with sacred thinking to decode
                                             (mark her mark her darkest gray
                                             her spelling needs no judgment day)


 in Foulness such do flocks forebode
where felines finger what they're told
