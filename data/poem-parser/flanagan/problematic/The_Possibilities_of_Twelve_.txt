              compositions in line and the color filled
         “you ; it thinks; Me sleep Me eat Me fly"
       effectum over morning the

   string of dressed flax
        marks twelve
flight patterns

                the great regulations chew the composition:
                       the first one, flatliner (land, dead)
                                 as a blau-lined one

                 the hand of God directs
               Moseses in the desert

this moment,     “directamente”
            the next flutter
       deserting the sky
