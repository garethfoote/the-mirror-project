                       Wish           this witness:

       a stretch of winter
       it is snowing into
       snow             each mouth humming            into hum   "Beautiful"

It is not possible to do this in a general way beautiful
among wintry domains, domains such as wining and dining, films and sport

Eyefuls of 文雅 and 質樸
the plain whited-out of things brilliantly kept bright, kept broadcast
no one walks no one walks about          then -

        man and the sky link themselves and call
all-the-world experience


Trauma is relatively simple:
      names should follow their bearers
      narrows should follow their becks

       become a brilliance of form, a fortress, a forum
       therewith in certain patterns

It is beautiful that it is-
a synthesis of the table at which the beautiful world sits

               found false in its own room-
               table window          dresser       drawer
