He don't know from nothin'
He was all flirtating with me
I have two words for you! Be-have!



       the sea ignites
boulders from salt



Lookâ€”they got those flatbread bitches

We change direction
     under the influence of water

       N' I said, if you come back to me, don't come back with a herpe, nigga.

       I bottle the wind.
