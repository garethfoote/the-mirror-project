Wednesday
the Avon Lady
lightens on the verge
of unbinding
[the origin, etc.]
a simple phone
call from the driveway

the mother
asks: where are you
stuck? The [precise working out of the]
face creams offer
four questions, that’s it
every week
bag a lake

spring-water
wells up from this box
shoved in a drawer
little promises—
a magazine
a person
some truth locates

a mountain [the range of powers
one obtains, absorbing]
cleared out every
five years
babysitting long
Buddha-range of
the Buddhas [i.e., the range of

powers cause vexation
and madness;
Buddha develops
a shift in pigmentation
as a result of
becoming Buddha]
