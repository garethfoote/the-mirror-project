1.

around the time of cardinals
about the time he was supposed to come home
             I sit and sit

in the middle of the arrivals
Buddha was not known
 by the time of the sky. He drifted in:

the stars and their seafaring
 they are what time textures
stepping gingerly up the stairs

outside the notorious
 hue and grit skulks
the dye of succor


2.

I sit and sit and fly and fly
I make friends with vikings:
they drink a lot, carry around wooden bowls

eyes as grey as the time into sleep
the god of the earth chuckles under his feets
the days shorten, turn an inedible color

awake under a thin red blanket
earthbound       torchbound awash with delicacy
lit as though through skin
