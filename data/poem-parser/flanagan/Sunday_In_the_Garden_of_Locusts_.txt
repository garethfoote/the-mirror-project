Sunday In the Garden of Locusts

Rockets ricochet! Windows rattle! Dogs wince while
each tree on the block demolishes each white playboy
--they are mass produced, so it bothers you less –

Make room for the cymbals of feet
Did you hear a pair of horses lunged into the crowd at the Puerto Rican Parade
            injuring 23 and killing one? In this noise no one can hear:
1. Paula Abdul, counting
2. The hydrant, spitting syringes
3. Sulking babies (mama!)

The night is now Dominican! BOOM bursts the kiddie pools
         golden car alarms bear the breath of sacred jewels    streets
float offerings of oil and socks and antifreeze and bandaids and pork-parts

      I look at your hands
fixed deeply into orange
as though you make

promises to the world
only you
can perceive:

               Eyes! L’glare! Open Heart! Ears!
               Who made such a sweetness
                determine this color?

               In this moment, across the studio
               we occupy polar
               spaces and times:

you are famished
you are full
you can pull color deep from bones

       I come to know this because
       I am tired of their shapes
       you ask how much my dreams concern Bodhidharma             (they smoke)

A low-rider
lets us pass
