To Find the Limits of World

When does one say, I know that x = pineapple?
When one has checked the calculation. This is
How one calculates. It is this. It is thus.
Connect to the concept of fruit

And multiply
The same distance from sun to planet, sand to leaf
Between you and I, stem and slip, your orange shirt, crowns and suckers
Drooling down the tart bathroom sink

These are not hypotheses,
But they are close.
Even when the calculation
Is sweet and fixed, it is not taught

Through any practical decision. We know
The nature of pineapples because
We learn to pineapple. The situation is not the same as saying
we have a fruit growing fat between us

This juicy proof
Ceases to be conceivable: Undone fruits together
Form edible Ananas hypotheses. No miscalculation.
It becomes then, not surprisingly
