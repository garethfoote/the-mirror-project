There Was Once a Stonecutter, Who Was Dissatisfied

Each character may say that
She or he contains the picture

Two characters demonstrate
Sunrises and sun decline. The ground

Writes in a primitive welcome, like the composition
(the sun) (the moon) with (mountain)

After the mountain goes to get down
The sun rises till an arrow pierces his liver

The character is written in the ancient script
Indicates the grass. Indicates the grass-thick growth

To enter contains the image
Represents the word related to the fact-picture

To enter contains imprisonment
The world drawn this time as failure-pile

This is real. The production of a happy image
Is also likely difficult.
