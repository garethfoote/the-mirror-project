Bodhidharma!
your father's not there
        he went to get milk.
The morning comes
and Japanese men
        burn down his
house, take
        the drapes first then

all the little girls

so he decides
to be a doctor:
        try to flagstone these things
from the inside


  and Patanjali!
your father's not
        there he went to
get beer.       The morning
comes and he's
passed out cold
        on the couch
        his cigarette starts
        flame in the
living room just like
when grandmother was
        found dead in the Bronx
                bathroom

Whether the world is eternal
       or not eternal
(spanning your dad's
       sportcoat-filled closets)

Whether the wreck is finite
      or infinite
      (given the range of broken watches
      jumbled in the drawer)

i.e. neither determined
