Insubstantial Stuff of Pure Being

Unbeknownst to me, a door opens under my bed. For a moment there is transference, as
though bound trains puff the sky. I know from the drip marks all about men's viscosity.
Just think, I might have been a clarinet with all that wandering. Black instruments. No
one has properly named desire, except by what is untasted, even festering. There â€“ with
this giant girl, no acts of dominion. A smokehouse, this city, making lost sponges
indivisible to touch. The sky holds unsleeping, tired-out angels. A terrible insult is this
skirt, clotted in gold.
