Ministering a Tornado (update with god II)


This morning, leaves still cling to the trees, but
          the sun is telling them to drop dead. The heavens fill
with saws, dust, fill with cuts of fabric in
brown and yellow patterns, with baskets and dogs and
men who need tribulation. So much filing through
          this place, oxen roads heaving left, then right. Thank
you for the nuns
          and trips to the symphony. The
drama of it: experience a body washed entirely
          in kidney sounds. There is an instance of Paul Bunyon
in my house, but it is not the same as yesterday. He
          tells the leaves up there to go for it, blands potatoes, builds
benches to dangle the feet, gets on with cuts and bruises,
consecrates with sweat the inadequacies of paper towels and flannel
