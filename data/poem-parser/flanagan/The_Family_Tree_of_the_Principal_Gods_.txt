a twelfth of the heavens
brushes those starred
bodies
  little tents pitched
for the soul this
mortal proper place
 a house

               you slice a pepper, seeds stick to your sleeve


the sense is usually
obvious, as in: maid, employee,
painter, house-work, yes—muse of scrubbed
domestic hues

               the green curry needs more coconut milk


carved from two worlds:
Muspelheim and Niflheim
What do you ask of me? Why tempt me?
go ask the spæwīfe, for already dead is she


            Mr. Kiwi's has cans for $3.99


and she answers thusly, with blithe eyes
cast on both of us
