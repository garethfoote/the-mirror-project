     the day wretches across water
     big: ocean one man, car-organized; another

     leaves a branch-cherry under cover
       thinks otherwise, on the contrary, out side

     the race of cold shoves breath
      up under the roof of the house

     ignorance sits here   :: is based here
     attended by guard (stone)

              gargoyle               waiting to
                                         know

     its call has tugged me with         wish
     in the water        leaves

              its
                        old shirts

     little else
                        the quiet sinks     secedes

                    water pushes the traitors' skin
     (only seems to go so far through)

     Grief is a before          and during and          after
        living

     re-living      the possible        upon
                        live and re-live the (lost forever)

     the way in which it is [d. all of the above songs]
        see it coming     (it comes)

     anyway. All day.
     All of me and you and the wrath of our first date-biting fingers. All sky.
