Insist:         repeat
                with more evidence
charity is the way we optimize agreement

we can never be sure we
understand what is said

look for a belief
by naming
the belief




Open:          the mind opens
               it asks a question
without the threat of going the other way losing out

to call untraceable a belief as
stars shift in their certain ways

learn to wish
for these
gifts of sky
