The Gloomy Sea God Known for his Beautiful Feet


I reach out for him and my hand
moves, overdue
corrects the clifftop-stand

(he bites my hair right through)

      we to be fierce
      we in the land

salty ships to understand:
that love hides in him
commands he has the feetest fair

I place my sand-arm

        in black glaciers
        they move like blood

the snow queen scratches her errands in Noatun harbor
an inconceivable chair
   on which we eat a golden

ice fruit   as love
