Assuming:     a state of mind
              a gesture
[mind-reading] when red tomorrows

secret forgers mediate
the meaning of your name

you see red
when there is
red




Tomorrow:       you remember this
                nature
similar tricks on us play

giving the name to the same color
you gave it thus

wish for an apple
by drawing
an apple




Cause:        intently stare
              the red thing
distinguish my toothache from your words

a system of symbols
withdraws the sentences

containing the name
without knowledge
without bells
