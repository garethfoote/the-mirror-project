 I am the Sea. I hold the land 
	as one holds an apple in his hand. 
Hold it fast with sleepless eyes, 
	Watching the continents sink and rise. 
Out of my bosom the mountains grow, 
	Back to its depths they crumble slow ; 
The earth is a helpless child to me 
	I am the Sea ! 

	I am the Sea. When I draw back 
Blossom and verdure follow my track, 
	And the land I leave grows proud and fair, 
For the wonderful race of man is there ;
