        I am the Rock, presumptuous Sea! 
         I am set to encounter thee. 
         Angry and loud, or gentle and still, 
         I am set here to limit thy power, and I will 
         I am the Rock ! 

         I am the Rock. From age to age
         I scorn thy fury and dare thy rage. 
         Scarred by frost and worn by time, 
         Brown with weed and green with slime, 
         Thou may'st drench and defile me and spit 

         in my face, 

         But while I am here thou keep'st thy place! 
         I am the Rock! 



         I am the Rock, beguiling Sea!

         I know thou art fair as fair can be, 

         With golden glitter and silver sheen 

         And bosom of blue and garments of green.
