## The Mirror Project - Collector + Poem Parsing

Python application for traversing specified hard drive directories on *nix (Linux, OSx, Unix, ...) systems, reading specified file types (docx, txt, pdf, etc), parsing the text and categorising into word classes using a Natural Language Processing library. Saves output as JSON file.

### Dependencies 

* Python >= 2.7
* C compiler (gcc or similar) - OSx without Xcode is missing this. Download separately from here: https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/downloads
